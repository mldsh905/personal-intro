                        work as a
                        designer. So, I am quite familiar with software like Adobe PS, AI. And after self-taught/code
                        camp, I finished several full stack projects and practice programs. And I also got AWS Certified
                        Solutions Architect â€“ Associate Certification.
                        I am happy to finish relevant trainings and courses in relation to full stack developer.

                        This website is a portfolio to demonstrate my projects and introduce myself. I am a fast learner
                        with a
                        can-do attitude. I learnt MERN stack in two months and afterwards completed several projects to
                        sharpen my skills.
